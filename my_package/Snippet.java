	Abstract - Flood is one of the most severe environmental hazards, causing significant loss of life and economic damages worldwide. The increasing frequency(more floods) and severity of floods, powered by climate change and urbanization, highlight the need for precise and advanced flood prediction methods. Traditional models often struggle to capture the non-simple, nonlinear interactions inherent in flood events. In response, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have become more important tools for enhancing flood forecasting and risk assessment. This survey provides a brief review of recent advancements in ML-based flood forecasting, exploring various models, data sources, and analytical techniques. The paper also discusses the integration of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) with ML models, the challenges of data scarcity(loss), and the potential of hybrid models. Future research directions are proposed to address current limitations and problems and improve the reliability of flood prediction systems.

	           I. INTRODUCTION
	
	Flood remains a critical concern globally, with its impacts due to climate change and rapid urban development. The traditional models, while foundation, often lack the flexibility to adapt to the dynamic and complex nature of modern flood events. This has led to an increased interest in machine learning (ML) approaches, which offer the ability to learn from data and capture hard patterns associated with flooding.
	
	The integration of ML into flood prediction provides various techniques, including supervised learning models like Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forests (RF), as well as deep learning architectures such as Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. These models have a good performance in handling large datasets and modeling the nonlinear relationships between hydrological variables.
	
	Moreover, the combination of ML models with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) has enhanced spatial data analysis capabilities, allowing for more precise flood risk mapping and management. This integration facilitates the analysis of topographical features, land-use patterns, and hydrological data, contributing to more accurate and localized flood predictions.
	
	Despite of advancements, challenges persist, particularly concerning data quality and availability. Many regions immune to flood lack comprehensive hydrological and meteorological datasets, hindering the development and deployment of ML models. Addressing data scarcity through innovative solutions, such as synthetic(artificial) data generation and transfer learning, is important for the broader application of ML in flood prediction.
	
	This survey aims to provide an analysis of recent literature on ML-based flood prediction and risk assessment. By evaluating various models, datasets, and methodologies, the paper is to identify current trends, challenges, and future directions in this rapidly evolving field.
